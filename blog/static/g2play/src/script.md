# Dragon Trouble
_Jester appears on the stage and he is playing a happy tune on his flute (this can be pre-recorded and he can pantomime playing)._
_He can appear inside a cutout of a giant storybook._

*Jester (Moussa):* Once upon a time, there were three families. There was a royal family of princesses that lived in a big castle.
*(Princesses appear from behind the castle)*
*Jester (Moussa):* A family of knights.
*All Knights:* Here! Here!
*Jester (Moussa):* The knights roamed around the castle to keep them safe at all times.
*Jester (Moussa):* ... and a family of dragons that lived nearby.
*All Dragons (Hassan & Yassin):* Roaaaaaar! Roaaar!
*Jester (Moussa):* But then some fairies moved in and created all sorts of trouble. Susie Sally
Sassafras was the worst of all.
*Susie (Aseel):* Peace is boring.
*Fairy 2&3 (Hala & Roya): nods and says:* Yeah!
*Susie (Aseel):* Let's make things a little more interesting.
*Fairy 2(Hala):* Yes, let's fly around and see what we can do for fun.
*Fairy 3 (Roya):* Let's go
Susie and the fairies fly up to a little dragon who is playing with something pretty.)
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* I love pretty things and pretty things I love.
*Susie (Aseel):* Those things are ok, but do you know who has prettier things than that?
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* Who?
*Susie (Aseel):* The princesses! You can go to the castle and take the pretty things from the
princesses.
*Fairy 2&3 (Hala & Roya): laughs:* HA HA HA.
(all fairies fly away and leave the stage.)
Little Dragon SNEAKS inside the CASTLE
*Jester (Moussa):* The little dragon sneaked into the castle and took one of the princess's pretty
things.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* This is the prettiest thing ever!
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* I love it! Roaaaaar!
(He grabs the pretty thing from her.)
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* NOOOOOOO!
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* YEEEESSSS!
(He grabs the pretty thing from her.)
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Where are you going with my pretty thing?!
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* Ha! Ha!
(The little dragon sneaks away and Susie and the fairies appear on stage. Susie whispers into
Princess 2's ears)
*Susie (Aseel):* You will take back your pretty thing and take all the dragon's treasure.
(Princess 2 chills and then looks mad.)
*Princess 2 (Rokaia):* Ehhhhh! Don't worry. We'll get your pretty thing back.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Oh please! I don't know what to do?
(Princesses skip up to a cave which is now in the center of the stage. Dragons are sleeping there.)
*Princess 4 (Malika G.):* Okay, now you go inside and get the pretty thing back.
*Princess 3 (Sumeyra):* Okay.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Wait! And take ALL their other treasures too.
*Princess 3 (Sumeyra):* No.
*Princess 2 & 4 (Malika G. & Rokaia):* We dare you.
(Princesses look shocked.)
*Princess 3 (Sumeyra):* Fine. But I get half the treasure.
*Princess 2 & 4 (Malika G. & Rokaia):*Deal.
(Princesses shake hands)
*All Princesses:* Gooooo Princesses!
(Princess 3 goes in and sneaks up to Little Dragon. Dragon moves while sleeping. She tries not to be
afraid. She finds something pretty, grabs it and comes out.)
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* I LOVE IT!
*All Dragons (Hassan & Yassin):* ROOOAAARR!
*All Princesses:* 0000ps! OH 000H!
(Princesses run and hide behind the castle. Dragons approach the castle and Knights try fighting
dragons.)
*Jester (Moussa):* All the knights were quite angry about the dragons trying to destroy the castle.
*Knight 1 (Selim):* We are quite angry.
(Other knights shout in agreement.)
*All Knights:* YES, WE ARE!
*Knight 2 (Fouad):* But how can we stop the dragons?
*Knight 1 (Selim):* We must harm them in the foot with the horn of a jackalope.
*Knight 3 (Orhan):* Where are we going to find a jackalope?
*Knight 1 (Selim):* Follow me. I know where the jackalope might be.
(The knights move around and catch a jackalope from behind a tree.. From the other side of the
stage, the princesses appear happily skipping along.)
*All Princesses:* Stop!
*Knight 4 (Omar W.):* What?
*Princess 4 (Malika G.):* You can't destroy this poor little innocent creature.
*Knight 4 (Omar W.):* Why not?
*Princess 2 (Rokaia):* Because he is soo0o cuuuuute.
*Knight 5 (Mohamed):* Stand aside.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Never! We are princesses and you knights must do whatever we say, rightn
*Knight 5 (Mohamed):* Well... We guess so.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* We command you to be friends with this little creature.
*All Knights:* What?!
*Princess 3 (Sumeyra):* Swear it!
*All Knights:* Fine, fine. Whatever. We swear it.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Good. Farewell little rabbit... thing.
*Princess 4 (Malika G.):* There must be another way.
*Knight 1 (Selim):* No... nothing else can defeat the dragons.
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* Yes, there is another way. We need a little fairy that can sneak through.
(the fairies overheard the princesses and were excited to join into trouble)
*Susie (Aseel):* Did someone say... sneak!
*All Princesses:* Who are you?
*Susie (Aseel):* I'm Susie Sally Saasafaras. The sneaky Fairy.
*Fairy 2 (Hala):* I'm Dana.
*Fairy 3 (Roya):* and I'm Mady
*All Princesses:* What can you do to help us defeat the dragons?
*Susie (Aseel):* Dragons eh? I have just the thing you need.
*Princess 3 (Sumeyra):* You do?
*Fairy 2 (Hala):* We know their weakness.
*Princess 2 (Rokaia):* You do?
(Fairy 2 makes a block of cheese appear.)
*Fairy 2 (Hala):* Cheese!
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* You've got to be kidding.
*Fairy 2 (Hala):* All dragons are lactose intolerant. (all princesses stare at each other with surprise)
*Princess 1 (Mariam):* O-k.
*Princess 3 & 4 (Malika G. & Sumeyra):* We need a knife.
(Knights enter.)
*Fairy 3 (Roya):* Will someone hurry up and cut the cheese?
(Knights cut the cheese with their swords. Princess 3 puts it on the pizza and they hide.)
*Dragon King (Hassan):* Somebody brought us pizza.
*Little Dragon (Yassin):* Yum, yum!
*Dragon King (Hassan):* Wait! What's this? Cheese! Oohhh!
(Dragons fall down. A couple of knights go up and look at the dragons on the ground.)
*All Knights:* Did we hurt them?
*Dragon King (Hassan):* No, we just have REALLY BAD tummy aches.
*All Dragons (Hassan & Yassin):* 0000wwwwww!
*Susie (Aseel):* We'll give you this drink if you promise to NEVER take another pretty thing without
asking first.
*All Dragons (Hassan & Yassin):* We promise.
(Susie pulls out a can.)
*Susie (Aseel):* Let me shake it up for you.
Jester plays the flute.
