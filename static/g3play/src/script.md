During the school year, we learned a lot about bullying, the types of bullies, and how to prevent bullying.
So, we decided to share what we learned with you.

Other students will show you the many ways we learned to stop bullying.

*(The students council walk forward)*

--

#### Student Council (Omar Y.):
Welcome to our weekly meeting of Bullies Anonymous.
This is a place where bullies can talk openly so we can all help them stop being so...so…

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
So bullish

--

#### Student Council (Omar Y.):
Exactly

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
So, listen up, you bully.

--

#### Student Council (Roya):
Mmm… Whom are you talking to, Omar?

--

#### Student Council (Omar Y.): 
Them, of course, Roya Looks like a tough crowd.

--

#### Student Council (Roya):
Oh my no. These are just visitors. *(Pointing to the audience)*
These are the bullies. *(She points to the bullies)*

--

#### Student Council (Omar Y.):
Oh, yeah. I see what you mean. They got that look. *(shaking his head)*

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
Now Roya we know that there is no one way a bully looks or acts.
Bully wants to hurt or control people, but they’re all kinds of bullies.

--

#### Physical Bully(Hassan):
*(jumps up)* Like me. I'm a physical bully.
I like to get in your face. *(throws a punch)*

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
*(jumps up)* Or me! I'm a verbal bully. I love to pick on kids. It makes me feel so cool.
*(Looks at a former bully or another student and says)* What are you looking at banana face?

--

#### Bully (Moussa):
I told you they had the look. What about those two?

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
What, them? They couldn’t be bullies. Besides, they're not clever.

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin):
Hey, that's discrimination.
We have just as much right to be rude as the other boys.

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.):
That's right.
It's in the Constitution.

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin):
Like for sure! We're social bullies.
Our favorite thing is to spread all kinds of rumors about other girls.

--

#### Social Bully 2: (Omar W.)
And then we totally exclude them from our way cool group.

--

#### Social Bully Group (Omar W. & Yassin):
We're BULLY-ICIOUS!

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
Ah, that's nothing compared to my fist.
That's what makes me cool.

--

#### Social Bully Group (Omar W. & Yassin):
Talk to the hand!

--

#### Student Council (Youssef):
That’s enough students.
We’re here today to help you to stop being a bully.

--

#### Bullies (Hassan, Moussa, Omar W., Yassin):
*(Act like they don’t care)*

--

#### The 4 students:
*(Return back to their seats)*

---

## Scene 3

*Song 2: Aren’t We Cool*

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
I keep things simple
I shove and punch
I break your glasses
I steal your lunch.
I'm in the hallway
And on the stairs
I'm in your locker
I'm everywhere.
Aren't we cool when we're cruel?

--

#### ALL FOUR BULLIES
Aren't we cool when we're cruel?
Aren't we cool when we're cruel?



#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
I'm into insults
That's what I do
I'll find your weakness
Then pick on you.
I love name-calling.
I know them all.
And some I'm writing,
In bathroom stalls.
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads 'NO')*

--

#### ALL BULLIES
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads and says 'NO')*
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads)*

--

#### EVERYONE (except the 4 bullies)
You're not cool,
You are pathetic.
You're not cool,
You are pathetic
You should quit,
Not one bit of cool.
You should quit,
Not one bit of cool.

--

#### Social Bully Group (Omar W. & Yassin):
We make up rumors.
We spread the dirt.
Then we exclude you.
Man, that must hurt.
We are all bullies.
Bullies unite.
We are all bullies.
Tell us we're right.

--

#### ALL BULLIES
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads and says 'NO')*
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads and says 'NO')*
Aren't we cool when we're cruel? *(Everyone shakes their heads and says 'NO')*

--

#### EVERYONE (except the 4 bullies):
You're not cool,
You are pathetic.
You're not cool,
You are pathetic.
You should quit,
Not one bit cool.
You should quit,
Not one bit cool.

*(All bullies go back to their seats)*

---

## Scene 4
*(Omar W. walks forward*)

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.):
You see…. it's actually not cool being a bully. No one else thinks being mean is cool at all.

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
*(walks forward)*
It’s just cruel and hurts both the victim and the bully.

--

#### Student Council (Roya):
*(walks forward)*
Hurts the bully!? How's that? It's such a power trip when you're bullying someone and all the kids gather around to watch.

--

#### Physical Bully Hassan
*(stands up and says)*
Oh man, I love that.

--

#### Student Council (Youssef):
*(Aggressively points to Hassan to go back to his seat)*
You're right, kids will sometimes do that. But they don't really like you...they're just glad it's not them.

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
*(stands up and comes forward)*
Maybe, but an audience is an audience, and I LOVE the attention.
Unless someone decides to step in and help the poor kid that I'm picking on.

#### Student Council (Youssef):
What happens then?

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
It ruins EVERYTHING.

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
Man, I hate that.

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
*(to audience)* Let us give you some advice.
When you see someone being bullied, just sit back and enjoy the show.

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
Sure! Without you watching us being mean, it wouldn't be any fun! Just relax and see us in action.

---

## Scene 5

--

*Song 3: Don’t Step In*

--

#### Bullies Group (Holding bullying signs)

Don’t step in
Don’t step in
Don’t step in
Don't step in
Woh oh
Just stand around
And watch us work
Woh oh
Just root us on
And be a jerk.
We love an audience
That's the best
We really count on you
If you're the audience
One request
No matter what you do...

--

#### Anti-Bullying Group
*(holding anti-bullying signs)* Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Woh oh
Don’t hang around
And watch the show
Woh oh
They love a crowd
They don't want you to go.
Don’t be an audience
stand and grin
That's not how it should be done
Don’t be an audience
Please step in
That would wreck their fun.
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in

*(All the students return back to their seats)*

---

## Scene 6

--

#### Hala (Student Council):
*(Goes to the mic. holding a piece of paper in her hand.)*
Okay, bullies, I've got here a list of basic characteristics you all share. Sort of a guide to bulliosity.

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin):
*(coming forward)* Bulliosity!? *(grabs list from Hala’s hand)*
Let me see that. I don't share ANYTHING with this pack of bullies.

Hey, can you believe this? *(reads from the paper)*
It says here that bullies are aggressive and need to feel in control.

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.): (coming forward)
Let me see that! *(reads from the paper)*
Bullies want attention!
No way! Like I'm aggressive or need to be the center of attention.
That's not me!

--

#### Former Bully (Hala):
Bullies also tend to refuse to accept responsibility.

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin): :
*(shouting angrily)* Hey, stop talking, I'm talking here!
It will be your own fault if you say something again.

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.):
*(grabs the list from yassin)* Bullies are unhappy, and jealous, and take it out on others.
That sounds ridiculous. *(Omar and Yassin go back to their seats)*

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
Well I'm not any of those things so that proves I'm not a bully.

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
Are you sure? Do you all mind taking a little test?

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
Test? Sure, I'll take a test.
I can pass any test. Uh, what kind of test?

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
It just so happens that a couple of former bullies -now science students- have invented a device that can sniff out bullies a mile away.

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.):
*(Shouts)* Bring them in!

*(Former Bullies 1, 2, 3 & 4 get the 2 bullyometers and go to the middle of the stage next to Bullies)*

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
We have created a machine that detects bullies.

--

#### Former Bully (Sumeyrah):
That's right.
We call it a Bullyometer.
And if you're a bully, it will tell us.

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
A Bullyometer? OH, I don’t like nerds.

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
I’d rather be a nerd than a bully.

---

## Scene 7

*Song 4: Bullyometer*

--

#### Former Bully (Malika Z.):
This little gadget can detect all hate.
It spots the ones who want to dominate.
And those who pick on the difference for a laugh
Will be detected by this bullygraph.

*(points the bullyometer at the BULLIES)*
*(AHMED, HASAN, & Fouad run back to seats)*

--

#### Former Bully (Malika G.):
So if you're jealous and don't like yourself
This thing starts beeping and leaps off the shelf.
And it's been buzzing at you for quite a while
But don't blame me because I just read the dial.

*(points the bullyometer at Yassin)*

--

#### Bullies (Yassin & Moussa):
*(shouts)* Get that thing away from me! *(runs back to seat)*

--

#### EVERYONE:
The bullyometer does not lie.
The bullyometer is not shy.
The bullyometer it tells things true.
And it's pointing right at you.

*(Everyone points to the bullies next to him or her)*

--

#### Former Bullies (Malika Z. & Malika G.)
*(Together)* If you are hurtful and feel no remorse.
This baby gonna know it all of course.
It shoots a laser at all those who flee.
And do not take responsibility.

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
Turn it off, turn it off! *(runs back to seat)*

--

#### EVERYONE:
*(Singing)* The bullyometer does not lie.
The bullyometer is not shy.
The bullyometer it tells things true.
And it's pointing right at you. *(Bullies return to their seats.)*

--

#### Malak:
Okay! Our meeting is halfway over. I think it’s time that we hear from some more ex-bullies.

*(Former Bullies 1-2  Hala & everyone LEAVE  the stage and take the bullyometer)*

---

## Scene 8
*(Farida,Rokia,Roshan & Mohamed come to the front)*

--

#### Former Bully (Farida):
So, what made you decide to stop bullying others?

--

#### Former Bully (Rokia):
We just got into too much trouble too many times.
It just wasn’t worth it.

--

#### Former Bully (Roshan):
Yeah! *(shaking their head)* Usually, when you’re bullying some kids, you count on someone ratting you out!

--

#### Former Bully (Rokia):
Ratting you out? What do you mean?

--

#### Former Bully (Roshan):
You know! Telling on you…. tattling.

--

#### Former Bully (Rokia):
Kids report bullies and say that we’re not cool.

--

#### Former Bully (Farida):
Even when someone is being hurt? That is not tattling.  That is helping!

--

#### Former Bully (Mohamed):
Not reporting bullies is the law of the schoolyard!

--

#### Former Bully (Roshan):
That’s not a good law.

--

#### Former Bully (Mohamed):
And then, you run into some students who are smart enough to know better.

--

#### Former Bully (Farida):
We are out of the bullying business now for good! *(Shaking their heads)*


*(Farida & Roshan & Mohamed & Rokia return back to their seats)*

---

## Scene 9
*(RECOVERING BULLY Ahmed and Selim walks toward the middle of the stage.)*

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Hi there, I’m Ahmed and I’m a recovering bully.

--

#### EVERYONE:
Hi Ahmed

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
The student council has been kind enough to invite me to this meeting and has asked me to say a few words about myself.

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
*(Comes running into the middle of the stage.)*
Sorry, I’m late. I lost track of time.

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
It’s okay just have a seat.

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
It’s my first meeting and I really need it.

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Sure, we all do.

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
I mean; I just can’t stop myself. I spend all my free time thinking about hitting the pins and getting strikes.
*(Late Student acts like he’s bowling)*

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
about BOWLING addiction of course.
*(Late Student acts like he’s bowling)*
Isn't this the meeting for BOWLERS Anonymous?

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
No, this is the meeting for Bullies Anonymous. Bowlers Anonymous is in the school’s library.
*(pointing to the library door)*

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
Oh no! I think I missed it. Oh well, I’ll just stay here and listen. If that’s okay.

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Of course, you can stay. Maybe you can help people out with their bullying problems.

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
You know…. I used to be a bully, but then I stopped because people did not want to be my friend. I decided to take up bowling instead.
*(Late Student acts like he’s bowling)*

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Do you have friends now that you’re not a bully?

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
I sure do. They even come to see me bowl.
*(Late Student acts like he’s bowling and then sits down)*

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
Now what was I going to say? Pointing to his head Oh yeah…. The student council has asked me to join today’s meeting to say a few words about myself. People are always asking me how I got over bullying. Well…. That’s easy…. I come from a long line of great bullies.

---

## Scene 10

*Song 5: Apples Don’t Fall Far from the Tree*

--

#### Brother Bully (Mohamed):
Oh I am Brother Bully.
I’m mean and I’m tough.

--

#### SISTER Bully (Malika):
And I am Sister Bully.
He taught me lots of stuff.
I yelled at him and shouted with words I shouldn’t say.

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed)
And my vocabulary grew larger every day.

--

#### Recovering Bully, Sister Bully & Brother Bully:
Apples don’t fall far from the tree.
I’m just like him *(pointing to each other)*
He’s just like me. *(pointing to each other)*
It’s not hard to spot our family.
cause apples don’t fall far from the tree

--

#### SISTER Bully (Roshan):
Oh, I’m the youngest sister,
I’m just like them
If you try to touch me, you’re gonna lose a thumb.

--

#### Brother Bully (Mohamed):
We once had a pet dog.
We sent him to the pound.
Because he wasn’t a bully dog,
He was a basset hound.

--

#### SISTER, BROTHER, AND RECOVERING BULLIES:
Apples don’t fall far from the tree.
I’m just like him *(pointing to each other)*
He’s just like me. *(pointing to each other)*
It’s not hard to spot our family

---

## Scene 11
*(Students return back to their seats)*
*(Recovering Bully, Sister Bully & Brother Bully return to their seats)*
*(Verbal bully & Student 1 BASHIR walk to the middle of the stage)*

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
Hey, you know what bothers me about this Bullies Anonymous meeting?

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
What’s that Moussa?

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
Well, it comes off like us bullies are big losers.

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
Yeah, what’s your point?

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
Well, we’re not all big losers.

*(Physical, SOCIAL Bullies, walk up)*

--

#### Physical Bully(Hassan):
That’s right! Kids fear us, and they respect us. And we got friends just like everyone else.

--

#### Presenter (Mariam):
You may think that’s true, but as you go through the school year, you become less and less popular and will start to lose friends.
People start to realize that no one wants a bully as their friend.
Bullies become pretty much friendless.

*(ALL BULLIES Look at each other surprised)*

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin):
*(says with attitude)*
I don’t wanna lose my friends.
*(Then sits in the middle of the stag)*

--

#### Social Bully (Omar W.):
I want to make friends, too.
*(Then sits in the middle of the stage)*

--

#### Physical Bully (Hassan):
I thought I am funny.
*(Then sits down in the middle of the stage)*

--

#### Student Council (Bashir):
*(walks forward and say)*
It’s clear now that bullies are not funny or strong.
*(Then sit down in the middle of the stage)*

--

#### Student Council (Roya):
You know what guys? *(looking at all the bullies, who are sitting and standing)*
Maybe, it’s not so great to be alone. *(talking to the other bullies)*

--

#### Former Bully (Malika Z.):
It’s not easy being a bully.
Kids are getting smart.

--

#### All the other Bullies:
Yeah *(shaking their heads and looking at each other)*

--

#### SISTER Bully (Malika G.):
Instead of fighting us, they are reporting and ignoring us.
They are changing their pattern and joining groups.
They’re not scared of us anymore.

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
They are becoming braver and more confident.
If this keeps up, the school will become a bully-free zone, and then,
Where would we be?

--

#### All the other Bullies:
Yeah…. you’re right? *(looking at each other)*

--

#### Physical Bully(Hassan):
You know what guys? *(looking at the other bullies)*
I don’t want to be a bully anymore.

--

#### Social Bully (Yassin & Omar W.):
We don’t either.

--

#### Recovering Bully (Ahmed):
After listening to everyone, bullying doesn’t sound cool anymore.

--

#### Verbal Bully (Moussa):
I guess you guys are right.
Instead of focusing on beating someone up, I should focus on being a good person.

--

#### Student Council (Omar Y.):
Well, I think we made some excellent progress today.

--

#### Student Council (Youssef):
There are lots of good reasons not to act like a bully.

--

#### Presenter (Mariam):
There are lots of ways to deal with bullies and keep them away.

--

#### Former Bully (Roshan):
Nobody should ever have to put up with bullying.

--

#### Former Bully (Rokia):
If you see bullying anywhere in school, you should say something.

--

#### Former Bully (Farida):
Tell a teacher or someone who could help.

--

#### Former Bully (Sumeyrah):
Don’t just be a bystander.

--

#### Former Bully (Fouad):
If you are being bullied, tell the bully to stop, walk away… And then go tell anyone that can help.

--

#### Student Council (ALL):
This concludes our Bullies Anonymous meeting for today.

--

#### Late Student (Selim):
*(runs to the middle of the stage with his bowling ball)*
Excuse me, excuse me… so is it time for bowling anonymous? *(acts like he’s bowling)*

--

#### EVERYONE:
*(says in a cheerful way)*
No, Because this is Bullies Anonymous!
