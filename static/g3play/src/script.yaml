RECOVERING BULLY 1Ahmed and Selim walks toward the middle of the stage.

Ahmed: Hi there, I’m Ahmed and I’m a recovering bully.

EVERYONE: Hi Ahmed

Ahmed: The student council has been kind enough to invite me to this meeting and has asked me to say a few words about myself.

Selim comes running into the middle of the stage.

Selim: Sorry, I’m late. I lost track of time.

Ahmed: It’s okay just to have a seat.

Selim: It’s my first meeting and I really need it.

Ahmed: Sure, we all do.

Selim: I mean; I just can’t stop myself. I spend all my free time thinking about hitting the pins and getting strikes. (Late Student acts like he’s bowling)

Ahmed: Excuse me, but what are you talking about?

Selim: about BOWLING addiction of course. (Late Student acts like he’s bowling) Isn’t this the meeting for BOWLERS Anonymous?

Ahmed: No, this is the meeting for Bullies Anonymous. Bowlers Anonymous is in the school’s library. (pointing to the library door)

Selim: Oh no! I think I missed it. Oh well, I’ll just stay here and listen. If that’s okay.

Ahmed: Of course, you can stay. Maybe you can help people out with their bullying problems.

Selim: You know…. I used to be a bully, but then I stopped because people did not want to be my friend. I decided to take up bowling instead. (Late Student acts like he’s bowling)

Ahmed: Do you have friends now that you’re not a bully?

Selim: I sure do. They even come to see me bowl. (Late Student acts like he’s bowling and then sits down)

Ahmed: Now what was I going to say? Pointing to his head Oh yeah…. The student council has asked me to join today’s meeting to say a few words about myself. People are always asking me how I got over bullying. Well…. That’s easy…. I come from a long line of great bullies.

Brother bully Omar W.: (saying proudly) That’s right! My sister learned how to be a bully from me.
Ahmed: How did you teach her?

Omar w: let me show you ,Malika  come here. (Malika walks over to Omar) Now sit down, now stand up and jump on one foot.

Malika G. Can I stop jumping on one foot now?

Omar W. No, and if you don’t listen to me, I’m going to rip up all of your comic books and call you names.

Roya: You see student council, bullies learn from other bullies.

 cause apples don’t fall far from the tree.

EVERYONE
cause apples don’t fall far from the treeeee.
Students return back to their seats.

























(Omar Y.walks forward)
Student 2 Omar Y. : You see…. it's actually not cool being a bully. No one else thinks being mean is cool at all.

(Malika G., walks forward)
Student 3 Malika G..  :  It’s just cruel and hurts both the victim and the bully.

(Roya walks forward)
Student 11 Roya: Hurts the bully!? How's that? It's such a power trip when you're bullying someone and all the kids gather around to watch.

Physical Bully Hassan  (stands up and says) Oh man, I love that.
 (Youssef aggressively points to Hassan to go back to his seat)

Student 4 Youssef:   You're right, kids will sometimes do that. But they don't really like you...they're just glad it's not them.

Bully …Moussa:  (stands up and comes forward): Maybe, but an audience is an audience, and I LOVE the attention. Unless someone decides to step in and help the poor kid that I'm picking on.

student 4 Youssef:  What happens then?

Bully…Moussa: It ruins EVERYTHING.

Bully … Hassan: Man, I HATE that.

Bully …. Moussa: (to audience): Let us give you some advice. When you see someone being bullied, just sit back and enjoy the show.

Bully …Hassan: Sure! Without you watching us being mean, it wouldn't be any fun! Just relax and see us in action.



Song 3: Don’t Step In

Bullies Group (Holding bullying signs)
 Don’t step in
Don’t step in
Don’t step in
Don't step in
Woh oh
Just stand around
And watch us work
Woh oh
Just root us on
And be a jerk.
We love an audience
That's the best
We really count on you
If you're the audience
One request
No matter what you do...

Anti-Bullying Group (holding anti-bullying signs)
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Woh oh
Don’t hang around
And watch the show
Woh oh
They love a crowd
They don't want you to go.
Don’t be an audience
stand and grin
That's not how it should be done
Don’t be an audience
Please step in
That would wreck their fun.
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in
Please step in

All the students return back to their seats Hala goes to the mic.
(holds a piece of paper in her hand.)


Hala: Okay, bullies, I've got here a list of basic characteristics you all share. Sort of a guide to bulliosity.

Bully Yassin: (coming forward): Bulliosity!? (grabs list from Hala’s hand) Let me see that. I don't share ANYTHING with this pack of bullies. Hey, can you believe this? (reads from the paper) It says here that bullies are aggressive and need to feel in control.

Bully B Bashir.: (coming forward) Let me see that! (reads from the paper) Bullies want attention! No way! Like I'm aggressive or need to be the center of attention. That's not me!

Hala FORMER BULLY:) bullies also tend to refuse to accept responsibility.

Bully B Yassin: (shouting angrily): Hey, stop talking, I'm talking here! It will be your own fault if you say something again.

Bully A Bashir.:(grabs the list from yassin) Bullies are unhappy, and jealous, and take it out on others. That sounds ridiculous.
(Bashir and yassin go back to their seats)

Bully C Hassan: Well I'm not any of those things so that proves I'm not a bully.

Fouad Student 3: Are you sure? Do you all mind taking a little test?

Bully ..Hassan:  Test? Sure, I'll take a test. I can pass any test. Uh…… what kind of test?

Student...Fouad: It just so happens that a couple of former bullies---now science students---have invented a device that can sniff out bullies a mile away.

Student … Bashir.: (shouts) Bring them in!

Former Bullies 1, 2, 3 & 4 get the 2 bullyometers and go to the middle of the stage next to Bullies

Fouad: We have created a machine that detects bullies.

Sumerya: That's right. We call it a Bullyometer. And if you're a bully, it will tell us.

Bully …Hassan: A Bullyometer? OH, I don’t like nerds.

Fouad: I’d rather be a nerd than a bully.


Song 4: Bullyometer

Malika Z.:
This little gadget can detect all hate.
It spots the ones who want to dominate.
And those who pick on the difference for a laugh
Will be detected by this bullygraph.
(points the bullyometer at the BULLIES) (AHMED, HASAN, & Fouad run back to seats)


Malika G.:
So if you're jealous and don't like yourself
This thing starts beeping and leaps off the shelf.
And it's been buzzing at you for quite a while
But don't blame me because I just read the dial.

(points the bullyometer at Yassin)

Yassin& Moussa: (shouts): Get that thing away from me! (runs back to seat)

EVERYONE
The bullyometer does not lie.
The bullyometer is not shy.
The bullyometer it tells things true.
And it's pointing right at you. (Everyone points to the bullies next to him or her)

Malika Z. & Hala & Malika G. Together
If you are hurtful and feel no remorse.
This baby gonna know it all of course.
It shoots a laser at all those who flee.
And do not take responsibility.

Moussa: Turn it off, turn it off! (runs back to seat)

EVERYONE Sings:
The bullyometer does not lie.
The bullyometer is not shy.
The bullyometer it tells things true.
And it's pointing right at you.

(Bullies return to their seats.)

Malak: Okay! Our meeting is halfway over. I think it’s time that we hear from some more ex-bullies.

(Former Bullies 1-2  Hala & everyone LEAVE  the stage and take the bullyometer)(Farida,Rokia, Malika G. & Mohamed come to the front)

Farida: So, what made you decide to stop bullying others?

Rokia.: We just got into too much trouble too many times. It just wasn’t worth it.

Malika G.: Yeah! (shaking her head) Usually, when you’re bullying some kids, you count on someone ratting you out!

Rokia.: Ratting you out? What do you mean?

Mohamed: You know! Telling on you…. tattling.

Rokia: Kids report bullies and say that we’re not cool.

Farida: Even when someone is being hurt? That is not tattling.  That is helping!

Mohamed: Not reporting bullies is the law of the schoolyard!

Rokia: That’s not a good law.

Malika G. And then, you run into some students who are smart enough to know better.

Farida: We are out of the bullying business now for good! (Shaking her heads)




Recovering Bully, Sister Bully & Brother Bully return to their seats
Verbal bully & Student 1 BASHIR walk to the middle of the stage)

Moussa: Hey, you know what bothers me about this Bullies Anonymous meeting?

Omar W. Student 1: What’s that Moussa?

Moussa: Well, it comes off like us bullies are big losers.

Bashir Student 1: Yeah, what’s your point?

Moussa : Well, we’re not all big losers.

PHYSICAL, SOCIAL 1-2  , & walk up

Hassan: That’s right! Kids fear us, and they respect us. And we got friends just like everyone else.

Mariam: You may think that’s true, but as you go through the school year, you become less and less popular and will start to lose friends. People start to realize that no one wants a bully as their friend. Bullies become pretty much friendless.

ALL BULLIES Look at each other surprised.

Yassin: (says with attitude) I don’t wanna lose my friends. (Then sits in the middle of the stag)

Bashir.: I want to make friends, too. (Then sits in the middle of the stage)

Hassan: I thought I am funny. Then sits down in the middle of the stage

Bashir:  (walks forward and say) It’s clear now that bullies are not funny or strong. (then sit down in the middle of the stage)

Roya: You know what guys? (looking at all the bullies, who are sitting and standing) Maybe, it’s not so great to be alone. (talking to the other bullies)
Fouad: it’s not easy being a bully. Kids are getting smart.

All the other Bullies: Yeah (shaking their heads and looking at each other)
Malika G.: Instead of fighting us, they are reporting and ignoring us. They are changing their pattern and joining groups. They’re not scared of us anymore.

Fouad: They are becoming braver and more confident. If this keeps up, the school will become a bully-free zone, and then….. Where would we be?

All the other Bullies: Yeah…. you’re right? (looking at each other)

Hassan: You know what guys? (looking at the other bullies) I don’t want to be a bully anymore.

Yassin & Bashir we don’t either.

Ahmed: After listening to everyone, bullying doesn’t sound cool anymore.

Moussa: I guess you guys are right. Instead of focusing on beating someone up, I should focus on being a good person.

Omar Y. Student 1: Well, I think we made some excellent progress today.

Youssef Student 2: There are lots of good reasons not to act like a bully.

Malak Student 3: There are lots of ways to deal with bullies and keep them away.

Fouad Student 4: Nobody should ever have to put up with bullying.

Rokia: If you see bullying anywhere in school, you should say something.

Farida: Tell a teacher or someone who could help.

Sumeyrah.: Don’t just be a bystander.

Fouad: If you are being bullied, tell the bully to stop, walk away… And then go tell anyone that can help.

All Students: This concludes our Bullies Anonymous meeting for today.

Selim: (runs to the middle of the stage with his bowling ball):  Excuse me, excuse me… so is it time for bowling anonymous? (acts like he’s bowling)

EVERYONE says in a cheerful way: Nooo, because this is Bullies Anonymous!
